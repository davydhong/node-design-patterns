| Name                   | GO4 Definition                                                                                                                                                           | WHY?                                                         | Notes                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**          | Ensure a class only has one instance, and **provide global access** to it.                                                                                               | multiple instances of an object does not share the property  | ```module.exports = new ClassName ();```                                                       |
| **Prototype**          | Specify the kind of object to **create using prototypical instance**, and create new objects by **copying its prototype**.                                               | Similar blueprints for houses in the same neighborhood       | ```cloned = {...this}```                                                                       |
| **Factory (function)** | Define an **interface for creating an object**, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class **defer instantiation to subclasses**. | Helps clean up the main file when you have *similar classes* | ```const factory = (...) => {<condition for returning different classes>}```                   |
| **Builder**            | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the **same construction process can create different representations**.                    | When you need *more customization than factory method*       | class BuilderClass feeds into ```new Class(Builder Class{ ... })```. Also, **method chaining** |

### Structural Patterns
> Structural patterns maintain the **same interface**

| Name          | GO4 Definition                                                                                                                                                             | WHY?                                                                                                                                                                         | Notes                                                                                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. **Adapter lets classes work together** that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. | Makes things compatible, while maintaining the *same interface*.                                                                                                                | ```class AdapterClass { ... <same props and methods as the target class> }```                   |
| **Proxy**     | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object (much more bigger/expensive object) to **control access** to it.                                                     | Useful for (1) managing expensive objects, (2) managing a remote resource, (3) provide data validation of input, (4) provide security, (5) cache data, (6) even log actions. | Similar to an Adapter Class, need to keep the same interface                                    |
| **Composite** | **Compose objects into tree structures** to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects **uniformly**.   | Allows **same interface** for both a single instance of a class and a cluster (array) of multiple instances. (**i.e. file system**: same interface for delete file/folder)   | methods on the cluster Class are recursive ``const cluster = new Cluster ([Obj1, Obj2, Obj3])`` |
| **Decorator** | **Attach additional responsibilities** to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible **alternative to subclassing** for extending functionality.                 | Decorator (class) takes an object and returns a new object with *similar interface*                                                                                            | ```const newObj = new DecoratorClass (inputObj)```                                              |


### Behavioral Patterns

| Name                           | GO4 Definition                                                                                                                                                                         | Why?                                                                                                                                                                       | Notes                                                                                           |
| ---------------               | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain of Responsibility**   | Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a change to handle the request. **Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain.** | Think of a *sandwich assembly line*. You can enter/retrieve the sandwich from any point in the process.                                                    |  subClasses are chained to form the mainClass. Constructor of the mainClass bundles the objects together, but the methods are deferred to the subClass.                   |
| **Command**                   | Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.                                      | Conductor Class provides a way to queue up commands, undo, redo, etc.                         | ```conductor.run(new CommandClass());```                               |
| **Iterator**                  | **Provide a way to access** the element of an aggregate object **sequentially** without exposing its underlying representation.                                                           | In another words, an iterator class is just a bundle of methods for navigating an aggregate data. (i.e. next, prev, start, last, ... etc) |                                              |
| **Observer**                  | **Define a one-to-many dependency between objects** so that when one object changes state, all its depents are notified and updated automatically                                     |  Use Cases: Subcription / Following                                                                                                                | ```<Observable>.subscribe(<Observer Class>``` Observable's constructor stores observer objects (as array, etc) and a method that triggers observer's reaction                                          |
| **Strategy**                   | Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,and make them interchageable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.                           | Use Case: DECOUPLING payment process from checkout process. Facilitates flexible payment methods (card/gift card/pay pal/etc)| ActionClass's constructor is built on **a strategy class, which is a bundle of static methods**. Action object's method invokes the strategy's static method.                                          |
